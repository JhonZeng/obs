This is a piece of Python code used to help bloggers who use obs for outdoor live broadcasts to encounter copyright issues due to unexpected outdoor music entering the scene. It monitors specific audio input ports on macOS using "pyaudio" and "librosa". When music is detected, it sends a command to OBS via its WebSocket API to automatically play an audio file to replace the sound from the audio input source. The program continuously loops to detect the audio in the current audio input source while running, waiting for input instructions. When the "reset" command is entered, all buffered data is cleared, all ports are closed, and the program is restarted. When the "exit" command is entered, all buffered data is cleared, all ports are closed, and the program is shut down.

principle:
This script continuously monitors the audio input stream for a specified input port on macOS. When it detects that the music exceeds the threshold based on the RMS value, it sends a command to OBS to play the specific audio file provided to replace the microphone audio to prevent copyright issues. The user confirms the numerical size of the threshold parameter through debugging, and controls the sensitivity of the program to detect music and cut off the live audio. It also waits for user input commands ("reset" to restart the program, "exit" to exit the program) and processes them accordingly.
