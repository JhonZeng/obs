This is a piece of Python code used to help bloggers who use obs for outdoor live broadcasts to encounter copyright issues due to unexpected outdoor music entering the scene. It monitors specific audio input ports on macOS using "pyaudio" and "librosa". When music is detected, it sends a command to OBS via its WebSocket API to automatically play an audio file to replace the sound from the audio input source. The program continuously loops to detect the audio in the current audio input source while running, waiting for input instructions. When the "reset" command is entered, all buffered data is cleared, all ports are closed, and the program is restarted. When the "exit" command is entered, all buffered data is cleared, all ports are closed, and the program is shut down.
